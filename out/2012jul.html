<h2>08 July</h2>

<p>A new attempt at a blog format. This totally isn&#39;t a thing that I do all the time.</p>

<p>Since I last made attempts to keep a log of my doings, I&#39;ve acquired ideas for research topics that are more specific than any other I&#39;ve had since I started this fool&#39;s errand nearly three years ago. It started with realizing that embodiment was a pretty keen idea, but it is, of course, not enough to chant &quot;embodied cognition&quot; and expect to solve the Synthetic Minds Problem (roughly stated: how can we make one?). Embodiment was an idea I got turned onto in May, but it wasn&#39;t until a couple weeks ago that I became taken with understanding sensorimotor dynamics. I&#39;m convinced that sensorimotor business is hugely important for perception (the sensor that moves itself!), especially spatial perception. The work I&#39;m looking at now is Lungarella and Sporns 2006 and some earlier work by Lungarella et al on &quot;information self-structuring&quot; which claims to show that considering motor interaction along with sensory input has information theoretic benefits. I haven&#39;t looked in detail since I&#39;m still brushing up on my information theory, but I&#39;m alarmed in that I didn&#39;t see much followup work to this (as determined by clicking &quot;Cited by&quot; in google scholar and skimming article titles/abstracts). It might be an insight but it&#39;s clearly not enough, so I need to find another direction to move in after this.</p>

<p>One thing I&#39;ve been somewhat fixated on is understanding proprioception and especially the vestibular system. My (mostly uninformed) hunch is that both are essential to spatial perception in vertebrates. I&#39;m torn on how much biomechanics is needed, despite my affinity for the &quot;embodiment&quot; insight. It&#39;s probably totally critical for understanding sensorimotor neuroscience (the motor signals are commands to a biomechanical machine, so it makes sense that you need to understand the biomechanics). However, it&#39;s not clear that modelling a realistic musculoskeletal system would provide insights to spatial perception that modelling some crappy artificial robot limbs would not. Maybe animal-like spatial perception needs the intricately controlled and flexible limbs that evolution has gifted us. Hrnm.</p>

<p>Current focus is Elements of Information Theory by Cover and a paper on &quot;Transfer Entropy&quot;, since the latter is a major measure used in the 2006 paper. I&#39;m also making a notes page on information theory to help me retain this better (I&#39;ve definitely read chapter 2 of Cover before and then forgot most of it, but IIRC that was during my post-bachelors SIUC days when I wasn&#39;t so great at learning).
