# group action

A **group action** of group G on set X is a function $\circ: G \times X \to X $ such that (blah blah goes here).

(From wiki): "If G is a group and X is a set then a group action may be defined as a group homomorphism from G to the symmetric group of X. The action assigns a permutation of X to each element of the group in such a way that the permutation of X assigned to:

  - The identity element of G is the identity transformation of X;
  - A product gh of two elements of G is the composite of the permutations assigned to g and h.

Since each element of G is represented as a permutation, a group action is also known as a permutation representation."

John Baez's page on torsors says that group action is important for torsors. Haven't gotten far yet in understanding.
