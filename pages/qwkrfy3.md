# qwkrfy3

Placeholder for my future page on my keyboard layout, a variant of the "qwkrfy" layout from carpalx I'm calling  qwkrfy. The big reveal is that instead of doing 5 swaps, I just did 3 (k/e j/o f/t). It seems to be a pretty good bang for the buck. Easy to switch to, typing seems more comfortable, doesn't disrupt too many vim commands (really only up/down in vim, which seemed like a dealbreaker at first but you get used to it.)
