# TODO

 - indicate datetime of last change on a site-wide and article-wide basis. possible changelogs as well
 - tags/categories for content?
 - separate the log content to a separate site section and possibly sub domain.
 - amazon s3 for content hosting? not a big deal for now, NFS is cheap enough)
