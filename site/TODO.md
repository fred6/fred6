# TODO

 - change pseudoscience to parse markdown files inside of folders (for hierarchical organization)
 - indicate datetime of last change on a site-wide and article-wide basis. possible changelogs as well
 - *solid references/footnotes system*. right now just having the footnotes availabe in markdown would go a long way (infonotes page uses a shitty hack based on in-page links at the moment). have to open up misaka and see what the fuck.
 - tags/categories for content?
